title: Design Details - Rounding | Microsoft Docs
description: Rounding residuals can occur when you value the cost of an inventory decrease that is measured in a different quantity than the corresponding inventory increase. Rounding residuals are calculated for all costing methods when you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.
