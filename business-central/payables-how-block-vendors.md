The following table describes the options for blocking suppliers.  

|Option|Description|  
|--------------------|------------|  
|**Blank**|Transactions are allowed for this supplier.|
|**Payment**|New payments cannot be created for this supplier.|  
|**All**|No transactions are allowed for this supplier.|
