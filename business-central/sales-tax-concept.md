# <a name="sales-tax-in-the-default-version-of-business-central"></a>VAT in the Default Version of Business Central

A **VAT*** is a VAT that applies to the purchase of goods and services for consumers and to the sale of goods and services for businesses. VAT, ideally, should apply to all final consumption with few exemptions. Exemptions in final consumptions depend on local authorities but generally speaking, business-to-business transactions should be exempted from VAT.  

Typically, VAT apply to the sale of goods and services and are a percentage of the total purchase amount. Retailers are responsible for calculating and collecting VAT at the time a purchase is made.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in countries that use VAT. The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has basic support for VAT and richer support in the versions of the application are used in the United Kingdom.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although VAT is available in the default version, Microsoft supports the use of VAT in the United Kingdom only.
