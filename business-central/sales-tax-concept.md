A **sales tax** is a tax that applies to the purchase of goods and services for consumers and to the sale of goods and services for businesses. VAT, ideally, should apply to all final consumption with few exemptions. Exemptions in final consumptions depend on local authorities but, generally speaking, business-to-business transactions are exempted from VAT.  

Typically, sales taxes apply to the retail sale of goods and services and are a percentage of the total purchase amount. Retailers are responsible for calculating and collecting VAT at the time of purchase.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in countries that use value-added tax (VAT) or that use sales tax. The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has basic support for VAT and richer support in the versions of the application used in the United States and Canada.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although VAT is available in the default version, Microsoft supports the use of VAT in the United Kingdom only.
