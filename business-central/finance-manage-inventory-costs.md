# <a name="managing-inventory-costs"></a>Managing Stock Costs
Cost management, also referred to as “costing”, is concerned with recording and reporting business operating costs. It includes the reporting of manufacturing costs and stock costs, that is, the value of items.   

Central principles to understand are that costing methods define how items are valued when they leave stock, that cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold with related purchase costs posted after the sale, and that stock values must be posted to dedicated G/L accounts at regular intervals.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
