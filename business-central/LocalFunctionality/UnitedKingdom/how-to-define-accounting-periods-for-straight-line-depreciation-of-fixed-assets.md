# <a name="define-accounting-periods-for-straight-line-depreciation-of-fixed-assets"></a>Define Accounting Periods for Straight-Line Depreciation of Fixed Assets
You can define 13 accounting periods to calculate straight line depreciation. You must calculate depreciation daily and distribute across the relevant periods. You can also define these accounting periods in the **FA - Projected Value** report.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  To calculate depreciation using both the old (360 days) and the new methods (365 or 366 days), create separate depreciation books; one for the old method, and one for the new method. Attach these books to the relevant assets.
