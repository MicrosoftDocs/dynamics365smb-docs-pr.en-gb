- **VAT Audit**  report â€“ This report is used for VAT auditing.  
- **VAT Entry Exception** report - This report details the differences between the calculated VAT and the changes that occur because of rounding, VAT tolerance percentage, and discounts. It also displays the difference in VAT amounts for the tax authorities.
