# <a name="set-up-your-business-information-in-d365inv_long"></a>Set up your business information in [!INCLUDE[d365inv_long](includes/d365inv_long.md)]
> [!Note]
> [!INCLUDE[d365inv_discont](includes/d365inv_discont.md)]

For the invoices to include your business address and other important information, you can define this in the **Settings** page. Here, you can upload your logo, specify your tax details, add links to your social network accounts, and make other general customizations.  

## <a name="to-add-your-business-information"></a>To add your business information

1. In [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)], in the top right corner, choose the gear symbol, and then choose **My Settings** .  
2. In the Settings panel, in the **Business information** section, upload your logo, add your company name, specify your address, and add other information that you want to capture here.  

The following table describes the settings that you can specify.  


|Section name  |Setting  |
|--------------|---------|
|**Email account**|Specify the email account that is used to send emails to your customers. This can be your business email or any other other email that you use to represent your business.|
|**Invoice and estimate numbers**|Verify that the numbers have the format that you want. To change the format, choose the button next to the number that you want to change.|
|**Payments**|The payment terms describe how quickly you want to get paid. Choose the button next to the field to change the value. You can add new terms to the list. </br> </br> The **Payment instructions** field defines the ways that your customers can pay you. For each invoice, you can choose the payment method that works best for that document.|
|**Tax rates**|Tax rates are needed so that your invoices can include tax. Add a default tax rate and, optionally, more. Check with your accountant if you're not sure.|
|**Payment services**|If you prefer online payments, you can connect [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)] to Microsoft Pay. However, in the current version of [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)], Microsoft Pay is not supported. The next update will add Microsoft Pay.|
|**Share**|Send the list of existing invoices to yourself or another email.|

When you are ready, choose the Close button. You can come back to the Setting page at any time.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Talk to your accountant before you change the numbers for invoices or estimates. If you have already sent invoices, for example, adding a new number sequence can be problematic later.
