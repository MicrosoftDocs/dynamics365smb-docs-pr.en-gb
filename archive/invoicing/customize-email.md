# <a name="define-the-default-email-message-in-d365inv_long"></a>Define the default email message in [!INCLUDE[d365inv_long](includes/d365inv_long.md)]
> [!Note]
> [!INCLUDE[d365inv_discont](includes/d365inv_discont.md)]

When you first start using [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)], your invoices are sent with a standard email text, but you can change that to suit your business.  

## <a name="to-customize-the-default-email-text"></a>To customize the default email text

1. In [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)], in the top right corner, choose the gear symbol, and then choose **My Settings**.  
2. In the Settings panel, scroll down to **Email settings**, and then choose the **Change default email messages** link.  
3. In the **Default email messages** window, write the text that you want to have as the default for the emails that get sent for invoices and estimates, respectively.
4. When you are ready, choose the OK button.  

> [!TIP]  
> This text serves as a template for the emails. In the greeting, the name of your customer will automatically be inserted if you keep the format of `Hello <Customer>`.
