Products are the basis of your business, the goods or services that you trade in. Each product must be registered as an item in the Prices list. An item holds the information that is required to buy, store, sell, deliver, and account for products you sell.

## <a name="to-create-a-product-or-service"></a>To create a product or service
1. In [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)], on the Home page, choose **Prices** .  
2. Choose **New** in the upper right corner of the page to add a new item to the **Prices** list.  
3. Enter a descriptive name, which will make it easier for you to find the item again, and enter a price. Check the **Add sales tax** box if appropriate.  
4. Click the arrow next to the **Price is per** box to choose a unit. On the **Select a unit** page, select the unit you want, and then click **OK** .  

    You can also add new units:  

    1. Click the arrow next to the **Price is per** box.  
    2. On the **Select a unit** page, click the ellipses in the upper right, and then choose **Edit List** .  

        You can add or delete rows, or edit the existing values. For example, you can enter code = 16 oz. and a description = Large cup.  

    3. Click **OK** when you're done editing the list.

5. Choose **X** to close the page (no need to save anything because data is saved continuously).
