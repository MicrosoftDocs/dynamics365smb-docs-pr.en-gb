# <a name="connect-to-intuit-quickbooks"></a>Connect to Intuit QuickBooks
You're using Microsoft Invoicing to create and send estimates and invoices to your customers, but you might want to use another system to handle your purchases, inventory, or bookkeeping. If you're using Intuit QuickBooks, you can connect to Invoicing. QuickBooks becomes the backend system for Invoicing, and your customers and inventory items are synchronised seamlessly between the two apps. Your invoices are synchronised from Invoicing to QuickBooks but not the other way around.

## <a name="import-contacts-from-quickbooks"></a>Import Contacts from QuickBooks
In Business centre, it's easy to connect to QuickBooks. Start by importing your contacts from QuickBooks.

1. On the Business centre home page, choose **Import your contacts**.
2. In the **Import contacts** dialogue, choose **QuickBooks**. Sign in to QuickBooks with your QuickBooks account.

    > [!Note]
    > Note: If your list of customers or items is longer than 200 entries, synchronisation with QuickBooks might take a while.

That's it. Your customers and items are now synchronised between Invoicing and QuickBooks. When you send an invoice from Invoicing, it will show up in QuickBooks a few minutes later.
