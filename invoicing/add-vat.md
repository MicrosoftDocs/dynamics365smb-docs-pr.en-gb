# <a name="add-value-added-tax-vat-to-your-invoices-in-included365inv_longincludesd365inv_longmd"></a>Add value added tax (VAT) to your invoices in [!INCLUDE[d365inv_long](includes/d365inv_long.md)]

If you or your customers are in a country that uses valued added tax (VAT), such as the United Kingdom, [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)] calculates the VAT for you, and applies the amount to your invoices.  

For tax reasons, you must also specify your VAT registration number in the Settings page.  

## <a name="vat-on-invoices-and-estimates"></a>VAT on invoices and estimates

Depending on your country, each line on an invoice or estimates contains a field to specify the VAT rate.  

You can't add or remove VAT rates, but you can change the default VAT rate in Settings. By default, [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)] uses a service to validate VAT registration numbers, but we recommend that you read the [VIES disclaimer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=841741) published by the European commission. If you choose to disable the service, you must verify all VAT registration numbers.
