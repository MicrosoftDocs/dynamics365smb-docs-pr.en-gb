When you add products to an invoice or an estimate, you can grant a discount at two different levels:  

- Add a discount on a specific item on the invoice by setting a *line discount*.
- Add a discount to the whole invoice or estimate by setting a *document discount*.

## <a name="to-add-a-line-discount"></a>To add a line discount

1. Open the invoice or estimate that you want to apply a discount to.  
2. Add the product you'd like to give the discount to, or select a line item that is already on the invoice.  
3. Give the line item a discount percentage by typing directly into the **Line Discount %** column.  
4. When you’re ready, send the invoice or estimate.  

## <a name="to-add-a-document-discount"></a>To add a document discount

1. Open the invoice or estimate that you want to apply a discount to.  
2. Expand the **Totals** section, and then choose the **Add discount** link.  
3. In the **Discount** page, you can specify the discount as either a percentage or an amount. Alternatively, you can enter the reduced total in the **Total Excl. tax** field, and the discount amount and percentage are then calculated automatically.  
4. Click OK.  
5. When you’re ready, send the invoice or estimate.
